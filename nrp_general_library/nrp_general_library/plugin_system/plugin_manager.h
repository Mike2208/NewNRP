The NRPSimulation executbable can load new engine types on startup. The names of additional Engine libraries can be supplied
via a "-p" parameter, followed by a comma separated list of engines to load. This gives users the ability to add their own
engines on startup and create new simulation configurations with them.

The NRPSimulation executbable loads one instance of PluginManager on startup, and fills it with a set of predefined search directories.
Should a user request an additional engine library be loaded, it will iterate over these locations until if finds a library file
matching the requested string. The user can request both a relative as well as an absolute path, both will be searched.

CMake is configured to load some libraries on startup. These are defines in the root CMakeLists.txt file, in the
NRP_SIMULATION_DEFAULT_ENGINE_LAUNCHERS variable, and will not have to be addded via the "-p" start parameter.

Creating C plugins is relatively straightforward. We have provided a macro to help developers create new engine libraries. The
macro is defined in nrp_general_library/plugin_system/plugin.h as CREATE_NRP_ENGINE_LAUNCHER(...). It takes the EngineLauncher of the
loaded Engine as parameter.
\bold Note that one library can only include one engine!

\code{.cpp}
CREATE_NRP_ENGINE_LAUNCHER(GazeboEngineJSONNRPClient::EngineLauncher<"gazebo_json">)
\endcode

A more detailed description of \ref EngineLauncher "EngineLaunchers" can be found \ref engines "here".

Once a plugin has been loaded, the NRPSimulation will add the newly loaded launcher to the running EngineLauncherManager, making it
available for Engine creation.
